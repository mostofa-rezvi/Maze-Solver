# Maze Solver Project with A\* Algorithm and Custom Movement Constraints

This project demonstrates an AI agent solving a 2D maze using the A\* search algorithm with specific, limited movement constraints. The agent can only move forward, or turn right/left and then move forward. It cannot move backward or turn in place without moving.

## Features

- **A\* Search Algorithm:** Efficiently finds the optimal path.
- **Strict Movement Constraints:** Forces the AI to navigate strategically.
- **Custom Start & End Points:** Users can define the agent's starting position, initial facing direction, and the goal.
- **Console Output:** Prints the AI's steps during runtime.
- **Graphical Visualization:** Displays the maze and the found path using `matplotlib`.
